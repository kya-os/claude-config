# Decision Log Template

Add to plan files, README.md files, or standalone decision documents.

## Format

```markdown
## Decision Log

| Decision | Options Considered | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| [What was decided] | [A, B, C] | [Which option] | [Why this one] |
```

## Examples

### Good Decision Log Entries

| Decision | Options Considered | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Auth method | JWT (stateless), Sessions (server-side), OAuth only | Sessions | Team familiarity, NextAuth already configured |
| State management | Redux, Zustand, Context API | Zustand | Simpler API, sufficient for app scope, smaller bundle |
| Cache layer | Redis, In-memory, None | Redis | Already in infrastructure, handles multi-instance |

### Bad Decision Log Entries

| Problem | Example | Why It's Bad |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| No alternatives | "Chose React" | Doesn't explain what else was considered |
| No rationale | "Options: A, B. Choice: A" | Doesn't explain WHY |
| Vague rationale | "B seemed better" | Not actionable, not verifiable |
| Missing decision | Just implemented without logging | Future maintainers don't know why |

## When to Log Decisions

**Always log:**
- Library/framework choices
- Architectural patterns
- Data structure choices affecting performance
- Trade-offs between competing concerns
- Anything where "why not the alternative?" is reasonable

**Skip logging:**
- Obvious choices with no alternatives
- Style preferences covered by linting
- Decisions already documented elsewhere
