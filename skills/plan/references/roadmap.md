# Roadmap Context

## Current OKRs

### O1:


## Active Initiatives

| Initiative | Owner | Status | Target | Completion PR |
|------------|-------|--------|--------|---------------|


### Status Values
- `Not Started` - Planned but work hasn't begun
- `In Progress` - Actively being worked on
- `Blocked` - Waiting on dependency (add note)
- `Complete` - Done, needs cleanup after PR merges

### Completion Workflow
When an initiative is complete:
1. Update `Status` to `Complete`
2. Add `Completion PR` link
3. After PR merges, move to "Completed This Quarter" section
4. At quarter end, clear completed items

## Completed This Quarter
